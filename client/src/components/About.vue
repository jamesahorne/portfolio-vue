        Hi, I'm James. I build websites and I like being creative with code.
      </p>
      <p class="u-text">
        After finishing my Diploma in Software Development in 2019, I spent 6
        months working as a web developer for a small agency building front-end
        solutions.
      </p>
      <p class="u-text">
        Now I'm looking for my next role as a front-end developer. I'm familiar
        with React and Vue and am practising my React skills while looking for
        work. I have some backend knowledge/experience too.
      </p>
      <p class="u-text u-text--highlighted">
        In my free time I'm a keen musician, having played acoustic guitar for
        over a decade and performing at various events. I also sing and play
        piano too.
