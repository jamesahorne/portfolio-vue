      <p class="u-text">Hi, I'm James. I build websites and I like being creative with code.</p>
      <p class="u-text">After finishing my Diploma in Software Development in 2019, I spent 6 months working as a web developer for a small agency. I focused on building front-end solutions (usually in the form of a pattern library).</p>
      <p class="u-text">Now I'm looking for my next role, as a front-end developer. I'm familiar with Vue but am interested in learning other frameworks. I have some backend knowledge/experience too.</p>
      <p class="u-text u-text--highlighted">In my free time I'm a keen musician, having played acoustic guitar for over a decade and performing at various events. I also sing, play piano and write songs too.</p>
